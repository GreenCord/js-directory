# js-directory

_v2.0.0_
Test Page: https://greencord.github.io/js-directory/

Exercise to create an example company directory using external data via AJAX/Fetch.
Notes: For demo purposes, code relies on ES6 and is not transpiled. The styles were designed through a mobile-first process, but not fully optimized.

##v2
Updated to use Fetch API; refactored to use some reusable module patterns.

##v1
This mini project was to revisit AJAX in vanilla JS to collect data from an API endpoint and then generate the content for the screen.
